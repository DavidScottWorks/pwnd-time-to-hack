# pwnd-time-to-hack

Two of the biggest security problems is password reuse and weak passwords. It's not difficult to understand why these happen. The average user has no idea it's a problem. Yes, security people understand it but not regular people. So I was thinking about what could be done to help that situation.

1. Let them know the password they want to use is on a list of pwn'd passwords (even if we don't use that terminology)
2. Let them know how easy it is to brute force their chosen password
